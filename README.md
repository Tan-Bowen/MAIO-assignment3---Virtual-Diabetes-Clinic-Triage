# MAIO-assignment3---Virtual-Diabetes-Clinic-Triage

Case: Virtual Diabetes Clinic Triage 

Context. A hospital runs a virtual diabetes clinic. Each week, nurses review hundreds of patient check-ins (vitals, labs, lifestyle notes) to decide who needs a follow-up call. Reviews are manual and time-consuming.

Goal. Build a small ML service that predicts short-term disease progression and returns a continuous risk score. The clinic will use the score to prioritize follow-ups. Everything should be built in a pipeline using GitHub Actions (https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Data. For the assignment, use the open scikit-learn Diabetes regression dataset as a stand-in for de-identified EHR features:

from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

Xy = load_diabetes(as_frame=True)

X = Xy.frame.drop(columns=["target"])

y = Xy.frame["target"] # acts as a "progression index" (higher = worse)

Treat y as a progression index: higher values ≈ greater deterioration risk (e.g., rising HbA1c/complications risk). In production, a clinic would train on real outcomes; here, we map the same mechanics to a safe, open dataset.

Users & flow.

Triage Nurse opens a dashboard sorted by predicted progression (descending).

ML Service hosts /predict that the dashboard calls for each patient.

MLOps Team (you) owns training, packaging, testing, and releasing the service.

Non-functional constraints.

Portability: Docker image must be self-contained.
Observability: Return JSON errors on bad input.

Reproducibility: Same code + GitHub Actions should retrain and rebuild deterministically.

Iteration plan.

Iteration 1 (v0.1) — Baseline: simple StandardScaler + LinearRegression. Report RMSE on a held-out split. Ship a working API & Docker image.

Iteration 2 (v0.2) — Improvement: try Ridge/RandomForestRegressor or better preprocessing (feature scaling/selection), plus calibration of the score if you convert to a “high-risk” flag (e.g., threshold on predicted progression). Show metric deltas (RMSE; if you add a flag, also precision/recall at a threshold) in CHANGELOG.md.

Grading
CI pipeline quality (3.0)
Runs on PR/push, fails on lint/tests, artifacts uploaded; tag workflow builds image, runs container smoke tests, publishes GitHub Release & GHCR.

Training & reproducibility (2.0)
Seeds set; env pinned; metrics logged & saved; clear instructions to reproduce locally.

Docker image quality (2.0)
Self-contained (model baked in), starts quickly, correct port exposed, reasonable size (slim or multi-stage), optional healthcheck.
Iteration quality & evidence (2.0)
Clear v0.1 → v0.2 improvement (accuracy/latency/size/etc.). CHANGELOG.md shows what changed and why, with side-by-side metrics.

Documentation & collaboration (1.0)
README (exact run commands, sample payload), tidy commit history/PRs.

Acceptance (what I’ll test).

I can pull the GitHub Release image (ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>:v0.1 and :v0.2) and run it locally.

GET /health returns {"status":"ok", "model_version": "..."}

POST /predict with a JSON of the diabetes features returns a numeric prediction:

 
{ "age": 0.02, "sex": -0.044, "bmi": 0.06, "bp": -0.03, "s1": -0.02, "s2": 0.03, "s3": -0.02, "s4": 0.02, "s5": 0.02, "s6": -0.001 }
→ {"prediction": <float>} (document your exact field names and response shape).

The v0.2 image shows a justified improvement (metrics + short rationale).

Hand-in.

GitHub repository URL (upload the link in a PDF here) — public.

The Actions tab must show:

PR/push workflow (lint, unit tests, quick training smoke, artifacts).

Tag workflow (v*) that builds the Docker image, runs container smoke tests, pushes to GHCR, and publishes a GitHub Release with metrics/changelog.
